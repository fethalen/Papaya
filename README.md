# "Papaya" Theme for Visual Studio Code

This theme is an adaption of [HenryNewcomer's "Papaya" Theme for
Vim](https://github.com/HenryNewcomer/vim-theme-papaya). It provides a rich
color palette, with colors that are easy to distinguish, while remaining easy on
your eyes.

Some of the syntax coloring elements in Vim do not have a direct equivalent
inside of VS Code and *vice versa*, but I've tried to adhear to the original
theme as best as I can. Please let me know if you see something that sticks
out.

## Installation

1. Open the "Extensions" tab in the sidebar by typing <kbd>⇧</kbd> +
   <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd> on Windows or Linux, or by typing <kbd>⇧</kbd>
   + <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd> on macOS
